Miscellaneous configs, script and utils for my DEV environment

in-document references straight, then clean the destination folder of scruff
files and finally open the resulting PDF with evince
* backup.py picks files of predefined extensions in predefined directories
(and their subdirectories), zips them and finally sends the zipped archive
to your gmail account
